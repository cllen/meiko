The article by Willer, Ottenbacher, and Coad (1994) presents the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ), focusing on the tool’s development and its utility in assessing community integration of individuals, particularly those with traumatic brain injuries (TBI).

### Key Points:
- **Community Integration**: The CIQ was developed as a measure to assess the degree to which individuals with disabilities are integrated into their communities.
- **Measure Development**: The authors describe the process of developing the CIQ, including its theoretical foundation, item selection, and testing.
- **Validation Process**: The article discusses the psychometric properties of the CIQ, reporting on its validity and reliability as a tool for assessing community integration.

### Methodology:
- The study involves a comparative examination of different populations, including individuals with TBI and non-injured controls.
- The CIQ's performance is evaluated in terms of its ability to differentiate between these groups and its correlation with other established measures of function and quality of life.

### Implications:
- The findings suggest that the CIQ is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used in both clinical settings and research to assess community integration.
- The tool's implications for rehabilitation and planning post-discharge services are discussed, emphasizing the importance of community integration in the recovery process.

### Applications:
- The CIQ has been applied in various studies since its inception to assess outcomes for individuals with disabilities, including those with brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, and other long-term disabling conditions.
- It has become a valuable tool for practitioners and researchers interested in the social integration and community participation aspects of rehabilitation.

### Conclusion:
The work of Willer and colleagues contributes significantly to the field of rehabilitation by providing a standardized measure for an important outcome of rehabilitation—community integration. The CIQ facilitates the assessment of how well individuals with disabilities, especially those with TBI, are reintegrated into their communities post-injury, and it aids in tailoring interventions to promote fuller participation in community life. The continuing use of the CIQ underscores its importance in the ongoing effort to enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities through effective rehabilitation and social integration strategies.
