**Title**: Pragmatic Language and the Brain: Neuropragmatics
**Authors**: Perkins, L., et al.
**Source**: Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 12, Article 9, 2018.

### Abstract:
Perkins and colleaguesâ€™ article delves into the field of neuropragmatics, the study of the neural underpinnings of pragmatic language use. Pragmatics refers to the social language skills we use in our daily interactions with others. This includes what we say, how we say it, our body language, and whether it is appropriate to the given social context.

### Background:
Understanding pragmatic language involves not only linguistic knowledge but also social, cultural, and cognitive factors. The study integrates neurolinguistic and cognitive neuroscience research to explore how the brain processes pragmatic information.

### Key Points:
- **Brain Regions**: The article identifies key brain regions involved in pragmatic language processing, such as the prefrontal cortex, temporal lobes, and right hemisphere structures.
- **Neural Networks**: It discusses the complex neural networks that underpin the comprehension and production of pragmatic language, emphasizing the importance of connectivity between different brain areas.
- **Pragmatic Disorders**: The authors explore how brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases can affect pragmatic language skills.

### Methodology:
As a review article, it likely consolidates findings from various neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies to build a comprehensive picture of how pragmatic language functions are represented and processed in the brain.

### Implications:
This work has significant implications for clinical practice, particularly in the diagnosis and rehabilitation of individuals with pragmatic language deficits due to neurological disorders.

### Recommendations for Practice:
The paper may suggest assessment tools for identifying pragmatic deficits and interventions that can be used to address pragmatic language skills in rehabilitation settings.

### Conclusion:
Perkins and collaborators provide an insightful exploration of the neural mechanisms supporting pragmatic language use, offering a valuable perspective for both researchers and clinicians interested in the relationship between language and brain function.

This summary highlights the article's contribution to understanding the neural basis of pragmatic language, which is crucial for social communication, and its relevance to clinical populations with communication disorders.
