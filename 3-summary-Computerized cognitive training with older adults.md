**Title**: Computerized Cognitive Training with Older Adults: A Systematic Review
**Authors**: Kueider, A. M., Parisi, J. M., Gross, A. L., & Rebok, G. W.
**Source**: PLoS ONE, 7(7), e40588, 2012.

### Abstract:
The study by Kueider et al. systematically reviews the effectiveness of computerized cognitive training (CCT) programs in improving cognitive functions in older adults. It examines the evidence for CCT as an innovative tool in cognitive rehabilitation and the potential for CCT to maintain or improve cognitive health in older age.

### Methodology:
A systematic review was conducted of studies that used CCT with older adult participants. The review included randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs that reported on measures of cognitive function.

### Key Points:
- **Evidence of Efficacy**: The review provides mixed evidence on the effectiveness of CCT, with some studies showing significant improvements in cognitive functions, while others reported minimal or no benefits.
- **Variability in CCT Programs**: There is considerable variability in the CCT programs evaluated, ranging from training on basic cognitive tasks to complex simulations.
- **Transfer of Training**: A critical aspect examined is the transfer of cognitive improvements from the training tasks to daily cognitive tasks, which is a key goal of cognitive rehabilitation.
- **Engagement and Motivation**: The review discusses the importance of engagement and motivation in CCT programs, noting that more engaging programs are likely to yield better outcomes.

### Implications:
The findings suggest that CCT can be a valuable tool in cognitive rehabilitation for older adults, but the variability in program design and outcomes indicates a need for more standardized approaches and methodologies in future research.

### Recommendations for Future Research:
The authors recommend further studies to identify the characteristics of the most effective CCT programs, the duration and intensity of training needed to achieve sustainable cognitive improvements, and the mechanisms underlying the transfer of cognitive gains to everyday functions.

### Conclusion:
Kueider et al.'s systematic review highlights the potential of CCT as a promising direction for cognitive rehabilitation interventions, especially for the aging population. However, it also points to the need for further research to optimize CCT programs and to understand the individual differences in response to such interventions.
