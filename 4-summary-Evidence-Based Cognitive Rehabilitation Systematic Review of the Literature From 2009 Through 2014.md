**Title**: Evidence-Based Cognitive Rehabilitation: Systematic Review of the Literature From 2009 Through 2014
**Authors**: Cicerone, K. D., et al.
**Source**: Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 100(8), 1515-1533, 2019.

### Abstract:
The study by Cicerone et al. is a systematic review that aims to update the evidence-based recommendations for cognitive rehabilitation of people with acquired brain injury (ABI), including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke. It builds on previous reviews to reflect the latest research conducted between 2009 and 2014.

### Methodology:
This review evaluated articles using rigorous methodological standards to determine the effectiveness of different cognitive rehabilitation interventions. It included randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, and cohort studies that met specific inclusion criteria.

### Key Points:
- **Scope of Research**: The review assessed a wide range of cognitive rehabilitation interventions targeting attention, visuospatial skills, language and communication, memory, and executive function.
- **Strength of Evidence**: The interventions were rated according to the strength of evidence for their efficacy. These ratings informed practice recommendations.
- **Updates in Recommendations**: The review updates the practice standards, guidelines, and options for cognitive rehabilitation based on the current evidence.
- **Improved Outcomes**: Many of the reviewed studies reported improvements in cognitive function following intervention, although the degree of improvement and generalizability varied.

### Implications:
The updated recommendations provided by Cicerone et al. support the use of specific cognitive rehabilitation interventions and highlight areas where evidence is strong, as well as those where further research is needed.

### Recommendations for Future Research:
The authors call for continued research into cognitive rehabilitation, emphasizing the need for more studies with rigorous designs, larger sample sizes, and clearer descriptions of intervention protocols.

### Conclusion:
Cicerone et al.'s systematic review is a crucial resource for clinicians and researchers in the field of cognitive rehabilitation, providing evidence-based guidance on effective interventions for improving cognitive function after ABI. It underscores the evolving nature of research in this area and the ongoing need to refine and update rehabilitation practices as new evidence emerges.

This review is considered a critical document for healthcare providers involved in the cognitive rehabilitation of individuals with ABI, informing best practices and clinical decision-making based on the latest research findings.
