The article titled "Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport—the 5th International Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Berlin, October 2016" by McCrory et al. (2017) represents a critical consensus document on the management of sports-related concussions. This statement is the result of the 5th International Conference on Concussion in Sport, which is a gathering of experts to discuss and compile the latest research and insights into a coherent and accessible guideline for the treatment of concussion in athletes. Here's a brief summary:

### Objectives:
The consensus aims to update the guidelines for recognizing, diagnosing, and managing concussions that occur in sports, based on systematic reviews of the literature and the expert opinion of the conference participants.

### Key Points:
- **Definition of Concussion**: Concussion is described as a transient neurological dysfunction resulting from a biomechanical force, with a rapid onset of short-lived impairment that resolves spontaneously.
- **Diagnosis**: Emphasis is placed on a structured approach to assessing athletes for concussion, including the use of sideline assessment tools like the SCAT5 (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 5th edition).
- **Management and Recovery**: The document underscores the individualized nature of concussion management, recommending rest until acute symptoms resolve, followed by a graded program of exertion prior to medical clearance and return to play.
- **Prevention**: Discussion of helmets and mouthguards, rule changes, and education as means to reduce the incidence of concussions.
- **Pediatric Concussions**: The statement highlights that children and adolescents require specific management strategies, acknowledging longer recovery times and the need for a cautious approach to returning to school and sports.

### Methodology:
The document is the outcome of discussions from various sessions and workshops conducted during the conference, where topics such as basic science, youth concussions, long-term sequelae, and sports-specific issues were addressed.

### Impact:
The guidelines are intended to assist healthcare professionals in providing appropriate care based on the latest evidence and expert consensus. Moreover, they are influential in guiding policy for sports organizations and educating athletes, coaches, and parents on concussion management.
