### 1. Early Intervention and Assessment

#### Theory:
- **Early Intervention Theory**: Stresses early assessment post-injury for cognitive, emotional, and physical symptoms to mitigate long-term consequences.
- **Neuroplasticity and Early Intervention**: Explores how early intervention supports neuroplasticity, promoting recovery of neural pathways after injury.
- **Multidimensional Assessment Model**: Highlights the importance of evaluating multiple dimensions of patient well-being, including mental health, physical function, and social integration.

#### Implementation Plan:
- **Clinical Interviews**: Administer structured interviews to understand patient’s subjective experience of their symptoms.
- **Observational Metrics**: Utilize tools like the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) for symptom tracking.
- **Standardized Testing**: Incorporate neuropsychological testing using instruments such as the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) to assess cognitive functions.
- **Early Physical Activity**: Introduce light physical activity that adheres to a graduated exercise protocol, depending on symptom severity.
- **Patient and Family Education**: Educate the patient and family members about symptom management and the expected course of recovery to reduce stress and promote a supportive environment.
