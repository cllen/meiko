**Title**: Impact of Rehabilitation on Self-Concept Following Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review
**Authors**: Ownsworth, T., & Haslam, C.
**Source**: Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 26(1), 1-28, 2016.

### Abstract:
The systematic review by Ownsworth and Haslam focuses on how rehabilitation interventions after traumatic brain injury (TBI) affect the self-concept of patients. Self-concept is the perception one has of oneself, and changes in self-concept are common following TBI due to alterations in cognitive, emotional, and physical functioning.

### Methodology:
This review consolidates various studies that have explored the outcomes of rehabilitation on self-concept in individuals with TBI. The authors likely analyzed data from different types of interventions, both restorative and compensatory, to assess their impact on patients' self-perception.

### Key Points:
- **Self-Concept Post-TBI**: The paper underscores the psychological aspect of TBI rehabilitation, particularly the challenge of altered self-perception.
- **Rehabilitation Approaches**: It contrasts restorative approaches, which aim to improve function to pre-injury levels, with compensatory strategies that help patients adjust to limitations.
- **Effectiveness of Interventions**: Findings indicate varying levels of effectiveness for different interventions in shaping self-concept post-injury.
- **Restorative vs. Compensatory**: The review discusses which type of rehabilitation may be more effective in positive self-concept outcomes and under what circumstances.

### Implications:
The review indicates that rehabilitation has a meaningful impact on self-concept, which is a crucial component of overall recovery and quality of life post-TBI. 

### Recommendations for Future Research:
The authors might recommend further studies to explore the long-term effects of rehabilitation on self-concept and how these interventions can be optimized for individual needs.

### Conclusion:
Ownsworth and Haslam provide evidence that rehabilitation significantly influences self-concept after TBI. They suggest that both restorative and compensatory rehabilitation strategies can be effective but highlight the need for personalization in intervention plans.

This summary reflects the comprehensive nature of the systematic review, emphasizing the importance of considering self-concept in rehabilitation programs for individuals with TBI. It acknowledges the depth of the paper's contribution to the field of neuropsychological rehabilitation.
