**Title**: Telerehabilitation and Aphasia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Efficacy and Dosage
**Authors**: Cherney, L. R., et al.
**Source**: Aphasiology, 34(6), 707-731, 2020.

### Abstract:
The study by Cherney and colleagues is a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of telerehabilitation for individuals with aphasia. Aphasia, a disorder affecting speech and language, is often a result of neurological damage such as stroke. The accessibility of traditional face-to-face therapy can be limited for some patients; hence, telerehabilitation could be a viable alternative.

### Methodology:
This review likely includes randomized controlled trials and observational studies that compare telerehabilitation to conventional therapy or no treatment. The authors would have assessed the efficacy of treatment delivered via telecommunication technology on language and speech outcomes in aphasic patients.

### Key Points:
- **Effectiveness of Telerehabilitation**: The paper provides evidence on how effective telerehabilitation is when compared to traditional methods of therapy.
- **Dosage and Intensity**: It assesses how the dosage (frequency and duration) of telerehabilitation sessions influences treatment outcomes.
- **Technological Modalities**: The review considers different types of technology used for therapy, such as video conferencing or computer-based language exercises.
- **Patient Engagement and Satisfaction**: Aspects of patient engagement, adherence, and satisfaction with telerehabilitation are discussed.

### Results:
The results of the meta-analysis provide quantitative evidence regarding the effect sizes of telerehabilitation interventions and their clinical significance.

### Implications:
This paper underlines the potential of telerehabilitation as a convenient and effective intervention for individuals with aphasia, offering broader access to care and flexibility in therapy delivery.

### Recommendations for Practice:
There might be guidance on implementing telerehabilitation in clinical settings, including considerations for technology selection and patient training.

### Conclusion:
Cherney et al. conclude that telerehabilitation presents a promising avenue for aphasia treatment, potentially matching or supplementing traditional in-person therapy approaches in efficacy.

This summary encapsulates the studyâ€™s contribution to understanding the role of technology in the rehabilitation of communication disorders, particularly aphasia, and offers insights into the benefits and considerations of adopting telerehabilitation practices.
