**Title**: Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation for people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease: A review.
**Authors**: Linda Clare and Robert T. Woods
**Source**: Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 2004, Vol. 14, No. 4, pages 385-401.

### Abstract:
This article by Clare and Woods (2004) presents a comprehensive review of the research literature related to cognitive training and rehabilitation among individuals with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions in enhancing cognitive function, delaying the progression of cognitive decline, or improving the quality of life for those diagnosed with early-stage AD.

### Methodology:
The authors systematically review studies that have been conducted on cognitive rehabilitation and training in early-stage AD from available databases and journals up to the year 2004. The inclusion criteria for the reviewed studies involve participants with a diagnosis of early-stage AD and interventions specifically designed to target cognitive outcomes.

### Findings:
- **Cognitive Training**: Studies on cognitive training typically focus on practicing specific cognitive tasks to improve performance in those tasks. The review indicates that, while patients may show improvement in the trained tasks, generalization to untrained tasks or everyday activities is limited.
  
- **Cognitive Rehabilitation**: Unlike cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation is more personalized and functional, aiming to enhance the patient's engagement in personally relevant activities. The review reveals that cognitive rehabilitation shows promise, with patients reporting improvements in daily functioning and achieving personal goals.

- **Combination Approaches**: Some studies examined combined approaches, integrating cognitive training with other therapies such as medication, behavioral interventions, or psychoeducation. The review suggests these may be more effective than cognitive interventions alone.

### Implications:
The authors emphasize that while there is some evidence to support the use of cognitive training and rehabilitation in early-stage AD, there is a need for more rigorously designed studies with larger sample sizes to establish their effectiveness. Interventions need to be tailored to individual needs and aimed at improving real-life outcomes.

### Recommendations for Future Research:
Clare and Woods (2004) recommend that future research should focus on long-term effects of cognitive rehabilitation, the optimal timing for intervention, and the incorporation of new technologies in the design of these interventions. They also highlight the importance of considering the perspectives of both patients and caregivers in the development and assessment of cognitive rehabilitation programs.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the review by Clare and Woods suggests that cognitive training and rehabilitation may offer benefits for individuals with early-stage AD, but the field requires further development. The potential for these interventions to improve quality of life and functional independence warrants continued investigation, with a focus on personalized, meaningful outcomes and the development of best practice guidelines.
