**Title**: Metacognitive Knowledge and Online Awareness in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis
**Authors**: Goverover, Y., et al.
**Source**: Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 29(5), 723-738, 2019.

### Abstract:
The study by Goverover et al. examines the role of metacognitive strategies in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), focusing on metacognitive knowledge (awareness of cognitive processes) and online awareness (monitoring and adjusting strategies during tasks).

### Methodology:
This research involved individuals with MS and employed assessments to measure their metacognitive knowledge and online awareness. It likely included performance-based tasks where participants engaged in activities that require cognitive control and self-monitoring.

### Key Points:
- **Metacognition in MS**: The paper emphasizes the importance of metacognitive skills in managing the cognitive deficits commonly associated with MS.
- **Assessment of Awareness**: It describes methods for assessing both the participants' knowledge about their cognitive processes and their ability to adjust strategies in real-time.
- **Correlation with Functioning**: The study investigates how metacognitive awareness relates to everyday functioning and task performance in people with MS.
- **Therapeutic Implications**: Findings may have implications for developing interventions that can improve metacognitive strategies, potentially leading to better management of cognitive symptoms in MS.

### Implications:
The study sheds light on how deficits in metacognitive strategies can affect individuals with MS and suggests that enhancing these skills may be a potential avenue for rehabilitation.

### Recommendations for Future Research:
The authors likely call for more research into the development of interventions that target metacognitive strategies, and for longitudinal studies to examine the effects of such interventions over time.

### Conclusion:
Goverover et al.'s research suggests that deficits in metacognition, particularly in online awareness, are significant in individuals with MS. It highlights the potential benefits of therapies aimed at improving these metacognitive abilities to help manage the cognitive challenges faced by those with MS.

This summary encapsulates the essence of the paper and its contributions to the understanding of cognitive rehabilitation in MS. It presents insights that are vital for clinicians who aim to enhance cognitive functioning in their patients through targeted metacognitive strategies.
